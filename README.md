## I started by
using the ```create-react app```

## I then added in
 - ```axios``` for the api call
 - ```lodash``` to use some of their functions
 - ```react-flexbox-grid``` to get the categories to flow on to more than one row



 ## I still need to work on:
  1. Loading the item list for each category into separate routes based on id so the back and forward browser buttons work

  2. Adding in the search box to filter the items

  3. Understand the toggle function so can un-bold categories and items if I click on them again, rather than using id to assign the active class

  4. Use JS to hode/ show the item descriptions rather than hacking this with css

  5. Building the tests for the app - I know these should be built first, but as this is a new language for me I wanted to crack on with learning and building before tackling learning about testing.

## To build in development use

```yarn install``` and then ```yarn start``` to open in localhost:3000
